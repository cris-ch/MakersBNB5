# MakersBNB5

We are creating a web app that allows users to list their BnB spaces for rent and to hire BnB spaces for the night.
----

# Setting up databases and tables

To set up the production database:
1. Create database named 'makersbnb'
2. Run query in 01_create_space_table.sql
3. Run query in 02_create_user_table.sql

To set up the test database:
1. Create database named 'makersbnb_test'
2. Run query in 01_create_space_table.sql
3. Run query in 02_create_user_table.sql
 
**User Specifications:**

* Any signed-up user can list a new space.
* Users can list multiple spaces. 
* Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
* Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
* Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
* Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
* Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
